However, the fitness scores of architectures involving iterative refinement and multi-agent systems are relatively low, suggesting that these approaches may be too complex or require more fine-tuning. The knowledge integration approach showed some promise but was limited by the hardcoded knowledge snippets. It is important to avoid testing/refinement approaches since they have been over-explored.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nI propose a \"MetaReasoningAgent\" that can dynamically select the best reasoning strategy by first reasoning about the task and then choosing the appropriate reasoning strategy from a predefined set of strategies.

It is important to avoid testing/refinement approaches since they have been over-explored. Knowledge integration showed some promise but was limited by the hardcoded knowledge snippets. A promising architecture to consider is a multi-agent collaborative approach, where different agents specialize in different aspects of the task. To avoid architectures similar to `IterativeRefinementTeam`, I will propose a \"Parallel Reasoning with Aggregation Agent\", that leverages multiple agents reasoning in parallel and then aggregating their reasoning to arrive at a final answer. This approach allows to explore diverse reasoning paths and combining the strengths of different agents, leading to more robust and reliable answers.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe `ParallelReasoningWithAggregationAgent` will consist of three reasoning agents operating in parallel (e.g., CoT, Direct Answer, and Rule-based Reasoning) and a final aggregation agent. Each reasoning agent will generate an answer based on its specialized reasoning strategy. The aggregation agent will then analyze the reasoning paths and answers from each agent and select the best answer based on consistency, plausibility, and support from multiple agents.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1.
