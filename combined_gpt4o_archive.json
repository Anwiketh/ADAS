Firstly, the decision to refine or not should prioritize answers with higher confidence scores, potentially avoiding unnecessary refinements. Secondly, the process of consolidating the answers could be more robust by ensuring that the highest weighted answer is not only the most common but also meets a minimum confidence threshold. Additionally, small improvements in handling the results, such as avoiding redundant critique calls, can enhance performance.",
